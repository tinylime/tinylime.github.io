			<article><h3>I Will Wait</h3></br>
				<p> Well, I came home</br>
Like a stone</br>
And I fell heavy into your arms</br>
These days of dust</br>
Which we've known</br>
Will blow away with this new sun </p>

<p>But I'll kneel down,</br>
Wait for now</br>
And I'll kneel down,</br>
Know my ground</p> 

<p>And I will wait, I will wait for you</br>
And I will wait, I will wait for you</p>

<p> O break my step</br>
And relent</br>
Well, you forgave and I won't forget</br>
Know what we've seen</br>
And him with less</br>
Now in some way shake the excess</p> 

<p>Cause I will wait, I will wait for you</br>
And I will wait, I will wait for you</br>
And I will wait, I will wait for you</br>
And I will wait, I will wait for you </p>

<p>Now I'll be bold</br>
As well as strong</br>
And use my head alongside my heart</br>
So tame my flesh</br>
And fix my eyes</br>
A tethered mind freed from the lies</p> 

<p>And I'll kneel down,</br>
Wait for now</br>
I'll kneel down,</br>
Know my ground </p>

<p>Raise my hands</br>
Paint my spirit gold</br>
And bow my head</br>
Keep my heart slow </p>

<p> 'Cause I will wait, I will wait for you</br>
And I will wait, I will wait for you</br>
And I will wait, I will wait for you</br>
And I will wait, I will wait for you</p></article>
