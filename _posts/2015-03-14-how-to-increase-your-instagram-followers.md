title: How to Increase Your Instagram Followers
--- 

Instagram is a great platform to reach users of various ages. According to the Pew Research Center in 2014, 26% of the Internet uses Instagram and 53% are young adults between the ages of 18-29. That’s a large market that can easily be reached if you approach it correctly. Creating a positive Instagram image takes a lot of manicuring and pruning so imagine your Instagram as a beautiful lush garden. It needs care and lots of attention. You want to approach users (water your plants) at the right time to get the quickest and most satisfying result.

**1. Create Good content:**
If you’re guilty of posting blurry or indistinguishable photos then that explains why you only have 10 followers. Posting bad photos is like having bad breath, no matter how hard you try people will look the other way. A person may follow your Instagram, but after two or three of your “signature” photos, they’ll tap that unfollow button faster than a nascar at the Daytona 500. So it’s time to capture photos with depth and meaning. Take photos that you can actually look back on and say, “oh! I remember that.” Posting photos that have meaning to you will probably have meaning to others following you. Creating good content will attract people who you can relate with. If you are a travel fanatic and post photos of your travels, then it’ll be easy attracting other travelers. Attracting people with similar interests will make it more appealing to be on Instagram and can potentially ignite your artistic vision. Here’s an [article](http://iphonephotographyschool.com/square-composition) that will help you compose better photos. 
Posting quality photos will also give you quality followers. Quality and quantity will eventually go hand in hand if you do it right. 

**2. Be active:** Now that you are creating good content on your Instagram, it is important to continue creating content. If you’re on Instagram once or twice a month, obviously your goal isn’t to increase your presence. To increase your presence, you have to be present. Plain and simple. Seek new profiles, seek inspiration through hashtags, explore what interests you and delve further.

Here are a few of the techniques I use:

*Follow Instagram users with an abundance of followers.* Just tap away and follow as many users as you can before Instagram prohibits you from further action. I usually limit myself to 20-30 Instagram users because it is much easier to weed out the ones that don’t follow you back. Do this as many times as you want until you reach your desirable number of followers. 

*Follow Instagram users that are currently active.* When a famous Instagram user posts a photo and you happen to be on Instagram, wait 5 minutes then follow the users that liked his/her photo. This works well because the users are currently active and will respond quickly to your follow. They may not follow you back, but your follow is acknowledged and they might go like or leave comments on your profile. Using this technique, I’ve gained over 1000 followers and over 200 likes on each photo. It is effective if you get your timing right. 

*Search and use hashtags!* If you are interested in travel or the nomadic lifestyle or food, use hashtags and you will find accounts with phenomenal photos and very little followers. You can use that as your opportunity to establish a relationship with the user. Rule in business: a genuine relationship can greatly benefit you in the future ( if you later decide to start a blog or a website, chances are they may seek your other profiles).

*Clipping and pruning your account:* After mindlessly following people within a certain group, it is your responsibility to keep your feed neat and clean. Download an app that allows you to see who followed or unfollowed you. I use Followers+ and it is my go-to app when I want to clean the people I follow vs. my followers’ list. 
	Here’s a quick tidbit: Never let the people you follow to exceed 	the people that follow you. You want people to want you not vice 	versa. I know it’s sounds ridiculous, but it’s basic psychology. 	People don’t want to follow someone who appears desperate for 	the same reason you don’t want to go out with the guy/girl who 	has asked everyone and their mother/father to go on a date 	before meeting you. Desperation is not attractive.
Back to what I was saying: Download an app that allows you to maintain your Instagram profile. Unfollow people who don’t follow you back, who don’t like your posts (known as ghost followers), and those who just clutter your feed with garbage. Use your best judgment because after all, this is your Instagram and you can grow it however you want to. 

**3.Engage with your followers:** Now that you have 1000 followers, you need to keep your followers happy. What makes people happy is being acknowledged. Comment on their photo, like their photo, and always leave a lasting impression. This is essential to creating loyal followers and possibly friends outside of Instagram. I’ve personally never met up with any of the followers I don’t know in real life, but I’ve heard numerous stories about blossoming friendships and relationships. People are open to communication and are often friendly if you are friendly and respectful. Being disrespectful will only cause you a whole lot of trouble. Be smart and know your boundaries. Obviously don’t communicate with anyone that makes you feel uncomfortable or threatened, that is what the “block this user” feature is for. 

**4.Try to be self-aware and aware of the lives of your followers:** This goes along with being respectful of other users. Just be considerate and understand that everyone has their own views when it comes to posting photos. It’s not your job to pass judgment or make someone else feel bad. It’s easy to be someone else on line, but don’t be a person you’ll later feel bad about. Promote happiness and positivity. Your Instagram is your personality and it represents who you are and your creativity.

If you follow these rules/guidelines, your number of followers will most likely increase. Unless you have astounding photos that are National Geographic worthy, you must apply elbow grease in order to get real, authentic followers.


I **highly** advise you not to buy followers or likes, although it satisfies the instant gratification we’re all used to, you’ll realize later down the road it’s a lie that’ll be very hard to get out of. In the end, it requires more maintenance. 

Good luck! And have fun.
