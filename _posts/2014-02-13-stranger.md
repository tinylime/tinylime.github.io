### Third title

Hello, My name is *Jessica*, and I like **puppies**.

    Never fall in love with a stranger
    And that, son, they all said to me
    And never fall in love with a stranger
    But I can't help it if she falls in love with me
    
    And never fall in love with a stranger
    Now, they've gone against my command
    And never fall in love with a stranger
    The pain is written in my hands
    
    But if I can't resist
    Find my way outta this
    
    She knows that our love more than any river flows
    And I'm done now, all of my intentions are exposed
    Not hidden in my clothes
    Or in between my toes
    
    I wanna tombstone pearl handle revolver
    Don't wanna meet a pale man with a halo in his hair
    Never fall in love with a stranger
    But sometimes I simply do not care
    
    And if I can't resist
    Get my way outta this
    
    She knows that our love more than any river flows
    And I'm done now, all of my intentions are exposed
    Not hidden in my clothes
    Or in between my toes
    
    I done things right, pretty much all of my life
    I'm not looking for any sympathy
    I can run all I like away from that stranger
    But somehow she'll always follow me
